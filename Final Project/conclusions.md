*Disclaimer: This conclusion is based on the figures given by the Bureau of Labor Statistic's website for 1961 to 2012 which were obtained on June 17, 2024. These figures are different than the ones provided in Canvas. If these differences change any part of the conclusion, it will be noted.*

Question: Did Bill Clinton have his facts right?
Answer: Short answer - *no.
Long answer - Clinton claimed that when Republicans controlled the White House, 24 million private sector jobs were produced. When Democrats controlled the White House, he claims that 42 million of these jobs were produced for a total of 66 million produced jobs. When solving for these totals with the BLS's own data, I found there were 32.677 million produced private sector jobs while the Republicans controlled the White House and 36.49 million produced private sector jobs while the Democrats controlled the White House for a total of 69.167 million.
*= In the data provided by the BLS_private.csv file from Canvas, his total produced private jobs claim was within 1 million jobs of that data. One could argue that this particular figure is accurate enough. His partisian figures are still incorrect, however.

Clarifying question: Was Clinton's assertion that the private job market does better under Democrat presidencies than Republican presidencies substantiated?
Answer: If we assume that the United States presidency can have a significant affect on how well the private economy does, then the simple answer is yes. Compared to his claims, the results from the data are closer to parity, only seperated by less than 4 million jobs if using the data directly from the BLS and less than 1 million jobs if using the data from Canvas, both in the Democrats' favor. The strength of Clinton's claim is significantly harmed, however.

Bonus question 1: In what ways is this the wrong data for the context in which it was being used?
Answer: Job creation is only one indicator of a country's economic health, and it's hard to directly attribute a US president's policies to private sector job creation. Unemployment rate, Gross Domestic Product, inflation rate, federal budget deficits, and the federal reserve interest rates are just a few other indicators of economic health, all with various levels of influence from the US presidency. Clinton implied that America's economy is better off with the Democrats in the White House by referencing job creation, when in reality, the President is incapable of directly forcing private employers to hire additional employees.

Bonus question 2: How could the numbers be adjusted to better reflect the influence that a president has on this data?
Answer: Signed laws and executive orders and then noting jobs numbers directly after these acts take effect can be one way to attribute a particular president's influence on job creation. Even in this case, indicating which party controls congress when a law improves job creation may make a stronger point.
